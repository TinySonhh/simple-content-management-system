### ‚úÖ JS Files & Folder Uploader (`js/folder-uploader.js`, `js/files-uploader.js`)

* Handles any file type
* Detects and distinguishes files/folders via `scandir`
* Uploads to dynamically chosen subfolders based on host

* Detects and distinguishes files/folders via `scandir`
* Uploads to dynamically chosen subfolders based on host
* Keeps upload history and returns JSON status

### ‚úÖ File Management (`api/files.php`, `api/delete.php`)

```

### ‚úÖ Any File Previewer (`js/any-file-viewer.js` ,`api/preview.php`)

Preview all files:
* `AnyFileViewer.previewFile(host_root, sub_path, file)`:
  - fetch files and folder using `api/preview.php` from a remote host file by this path `${host_root}/${sub_path}/${file}` on server
  - then render the corresponding content to the preview pane
* `AnyFileViewer.previewUploadFile(path, fileMap={})`:
  - preview the content of uploading files via the input controls (temporarily stored in browser memory (RAM), not on disk or server)
  - then render the corresponding content to the preview pane
  - `fileMap`: is the mapped JSON object of the input.files, using this method
  - `path`: is the key of a item in `fileMap`

```js
function getFileMapOf(files=[]){
  const fileMap = {};
  Array.from(files || []).forEach(file => {
   const fullPath = file.webkitRelativePath || file.name;
   fileMap[fullPath] = file;
  });
  return fileMap;
}
```

## Completed recently:

### 29 May 2025:
* change root-dir file listing
* implement previewer
* more friendly UI to select files and upload
* support select files and also folder (folder-uploader.js)

### Minor
* Respond to the 401 error so that users know what happen, and lead them to login again to continue
* Tidy it JWT

## TODO 
* Split FilesUploader as a single uploader as Folder Uploader
* Drag & drop (WIP)

Let me know if you want me to export this directly as `README.md` or generate a GitHub-ready project scaffold for you.
